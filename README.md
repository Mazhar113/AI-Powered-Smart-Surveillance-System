# AI-Powered Smart Surveillance System  
Real-time, scalable surveillance platform using AI, OpenCV, FastAPI, WebSockets, and a modern React dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a fully functional foundation for a commercial-grade **AI-powered surveillance system**.  
It processes real-time video streams, performs **object detection, tracking, facial recognition**, and sends **instant alerts** to a live dashboard using WebSockets.

The system is designed to be:
- **Scalable** (home → enterprise)
- **Extensible** (plug-in different AI models)
- **Fast** (real-time optimizations using OpenCV + async I/O)
- **Deployable** (Docker-based, production-ready structure)
